## Introduction

3DRM is a plug-and-ply module which can be applied to different 3D detection frameworks to detect 3D objects more accurately and robustly. We implement two applications on proposal-based methods and vote-based methods: OSegNet(Over-segmentation to generate proposals and PointCNN as backbones) and VoteNet. OSegNet is trained and evaluated on S3DIS dataset, and VoteNet is trained and evaluated on ScanNetV2 and SUN RGB-D dataset. 

## Usage
3DRM can be widely applicable on different 3D detection frameworks. For further information about our implemention on two frameworks, please refer to the sub-directories: [OSegNet-RM](./OSegNet-RM) and [VoteNet-RM](./VoteNet-RM).
